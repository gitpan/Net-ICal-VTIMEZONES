TODO for Net::ICal::VTIMEZONES

------------------------------

If you do any of these, please join the reefknot-devel list
and tell us about your efforts, however slight. Thanks! 

Roughly in order of importance, here's what needs doing:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix the installer. It's fairly hackish right now. Clean it up.
Make it do the right thing, not installing the timezone files
at "make", but at "make install".

- Bonus points for hacking Net::ICal and CPAN.pm to intelligently
detect whether you have VTIMEZONE files on your system already.
This module is a big evil beast, and it'd be nice not to force the
download on anyone who only really needs Config.pm and VTIMEZONES.pm.
This may mean that we split up the packaging differently; I don't know.

- Come up with a good way not to smash any already-installed 
Net::ICal::Config files. 

- Test on machines with libical or libical-evolution installed
and make sure that Net::ICal::Config generation is working properly.

- Test on platforms other than Linux.

- Test on Perl versions other than 5.6.1.

- Make the "make clean" step restore the templated Config.pm,
copying it back from Config.pm.orig.

- Make the "make uninstall" step uninstall the vtimezone files.
